# About

This is a work-in-progress book project about database programming using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core and ADO.NET, targeting SQL Server, SQLite, MySQL, JSON, XML and different data sources.

### Self contained content

The content is created as collection of references, where you can jump directly into any one of the chapter to learn about the chapter's subject matter.  

Each chapter and associated sample codes are self contain with little or no dependency on other chapters.  The dependencies are common models and class libraries, which can easily be included to a project via the "Add Project Reference" option. 

### Secure, Efficient, Manageable and Testable

In addition to knowing the programming language and associated technologies, Design-Principle (such as SOLID and DRY) and  Design-Patterns are important keys to developing manageable, efficient and secure codes with minimal technical debt . . .  While my intention for the content is to talk about the technology and how to use them, Security, Design-Principle and Design-Patterns are important keys in creating "Secure, Efficient, Manageable and Testable" codes, a few chapters are allocated to talk about these subjects.
